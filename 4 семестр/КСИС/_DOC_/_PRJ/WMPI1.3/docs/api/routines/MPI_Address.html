MPI_Address</H1>
Gets the address of a location in memory
<H2>
Synopsis</H2>

<PRE><TT>#include "mpi.h"
int MPI_Address( location, address)
void&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *location;
MPI_Aint *address;</TT></PRE>

<H2>
Input Parameters</H2>

<DL>
<DT>
<B>location </B>- location in caller memory (choice)</DT>
</DL>

<H2>
Output Parameter</H2>

<DL>
<DT>
<B>address </B>- address of location (integer)</DT>
</DL>

<H2>
Note</H2>
This routine is provided for both the Fortran and C programmers. On many
systems, the address returned by this routine will be the same as produced
by the C <TT>&amp;</TT> operator, but this is not required in C and may
not be true of systems with word- rather than byte-oriented instructions
or systems with segmented address spaces.
<H2>
Notes for Fortran</H2>
All MPI routines in Fortran (except for <TT><A HREF="MPI_Wtime.html">MPI_WTIME</A></TT>
and <TT><A HREF="MPI_Wtick.html">MPI_WTICK</A></TT>) have an additional
argument <TT>ierr</TT> at the end of the argument list. <TT>ierr</TT> is
an integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine
in C. In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
<TT>call</TT> statement.

<P>All MPI objects (e.g., <TT>MPI_Datatype</TT>, <TT>MPI_Comm</TT>) are
of type <TT>INTEGER</TT> in Fortran.
