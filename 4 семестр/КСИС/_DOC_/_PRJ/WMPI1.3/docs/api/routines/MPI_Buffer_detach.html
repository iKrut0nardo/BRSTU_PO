MPI_Buffer_detach</H1>
Removes an existing buffer (for use in <A HREF="MPI_Bsend.html" tppabs="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpi-report-1.1/node40.html#node40">MPI_Bsend</A>
etc)
<H2>
Synopsis</H2>

<PRE><TT>#include "mpi.h"
int MPI_Buffer_detach( bufferptr, size )
void *bufferptr;
int&nbsp; *size;</TT></PRE>

<H2>
Output Parameters</H2>

<DL>
<DT>
<B>buffer </B>- initial buffer address (choice)</DT>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT>
<B>size </B>- buffer size, in bytes (integer)</DT>
</DL>

<H2>
Notes</H2>
The reason that <TT><A HREF="MPI_Buffer_detach.html" tppabs="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpi-report-1.1/node42.html#node42">MPI_Buffer_detach</A></TT>
returns the address and size of the buffer being detached is to allow nested
libraries to replace and restore the buffer. For example, consider
<PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int size, mysize, idummy;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void *ptr, *myptr, *dummy;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A HREF="MPI_Buffer_detach.html" tppabs="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpi-report-1.1/node42.html#node42">MPI_Buffer_detach</A>( &amp;ptr, &amp;size );
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A HREF="MPI_Buffer_attach.html" tppabs="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpi-report-1.1/node42.html#node42">MPI_Buffer_attach</A>( myptr, mysize );
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... library code ...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A HREF="MPI_Buffer_detach.html" tppabs="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpi-report-1.1/node42.html#node42">MPI_Buffer_detach</A>( &amp;dummy, &amp;idummy );
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A HREF="MPI_Buffer_attach.html" tppabs="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpi-report-1.1/node42.html#node42">MPI_Buffer_attach</A>( ptr, size );</TT></PRE>
This is much like the action of the Unix signal routine and has the same
strengths (it is simple) and weaknesses (it only works for nested usages).

<P>Note that for this approach to work, <TT><A HREF="MPI_Buffer_detach.html" tppabs="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpi-report-1.1/node42.html#node42">MPI_Buffer_detach</A></TT>
must return MPI_SUCCESS even when there is no buffer to detach. In that
case, it returns a size of zero. The MPI 1.1 standard for <TT>MPI_BUFFER_DETACH</TT>
contains the text
<PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; The statements made in this section describe the behavior of MPI for
&nbsp;&nbsp; buffered-mode sends. When no buffer is currently associated, MPI behaves&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; as if a zero-sized buffer is associated with the process.</TT></PRE>
This could be read as applying only to the various Bsend routines. This
implementation takes the position that this applies to <TT>MPI_BUFFER_DETACH</TT>
as well.
<H2>
Notes for Fortran</H2>
All MPI routines in Fortran (except for <TT>MPI_WTIME</TT> and <TT>MPI_WTICK</TT>)
have an additional argument <TT>ierr</TT> at the end of the argument list.
<TT>ierr</TT> is an integer and has the same meaning as the return value
of the routine in C. In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are
invoked with the <TT>call</TT> statement.

<P>All MPI objects (e.g., <TT>MPI_Datatype</TT>, <TT>MPI_Comm</TT>) are
of type <TT>INTEGER</TT> in Fortran.

<P>The Fortran binding for this routine is different. Because Fortran does
not have pointers, it is impossible to provide a way to use the output
of this routine to exchange buffers. In this case, only the size field
is set.
<H2>
Notes for C</H2>
Even though the <TT>bufferptr</TT> argument is declared as <TT>void *</TT>,
it is really the address of a void pointer. See the rationale in the standard
for more details.
