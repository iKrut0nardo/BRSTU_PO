Notes</H2>
All processes must call this routine before exiting. The number of processes
running <I>after</I> this routine is called is undefined; it is best not
to perform much more than a <TT>return rc</TT> after calling <TT><A HREF="MPI_Finalize.html" tppabs="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpi-report-1.1/node151.html#node151">MPI_Finalize</A></TT>.

Notes for Fortran</H2>
All MPI routines in Fortran (except for <TT>MPI_WTIME</TT> and <TT>MPI_WTICK</TT>)
have an additional argument <TT>ierr</TT> at the end of the argument list.
<TT>ierr</TT> is an integer and has the same meaning as the return value
of the routine in C. In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are
invoked with the <TT>call</TT> statement.

<P>All MPI objects (e.g., <TT>MPI_Datatype</TT>, <TT>MPI_Comm</TT>) are
of type <TT>INTEGER</TT> in Fortran.
