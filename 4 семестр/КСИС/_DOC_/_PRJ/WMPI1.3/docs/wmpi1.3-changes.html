      <P><B>WMPI 1.3 </B>is mainly a bug fix release and it also brings some new 
        features.</P>
      <P>+Better performance for medium and large sized messages, especially on 
        high speed networks.</P>
      <P>+SMP bug fixed. It was a bug that caused computations to hang when run 
        on SMP systems.</P>
      <P> +Better resource management. Some resources were not deallocated at 
        the end of the computation, now there is a better cleanup. This cleanup 
        also applies to the processes. There were some bug reports about slaves 
        not dying. Now MPI_Finalize performs a better killing of the processes.</P>
      <P> +Minor bugs in the service and daemon resolved.</P>
      <P>+Compatibility with MPICH 1.1.2. As with the previous releases (apart 
        from minor glitches) WMPI continues to be compatible with MPICH so as 
        to bridge WinNT with Unix. (Tested w/ Linux)</P>
      <P> +Fortran bindings corrected. There were problems with string arguments 
        which have been fixed with a new interface.</P>
      <P> +Available for Alpha platforms.</P>
      <P> +Absoft Pro Fortran tools supported.</P>
